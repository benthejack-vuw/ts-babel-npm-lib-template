***description
a bare bones setup for an npm project written in typescript and transpiled with Babel.
Compiles with ES6 modules (import/export) for tree-shaking later down the pipeline. This will be an issue for some. just remove {modules:false} from .babelrc if you don't want this behaviour.

***installation
1) download / fork
2) ```cd path/to/dir```
3) ```npm install```
4) ```npm run compile``` to compile the library
